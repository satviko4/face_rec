# Face Recognition System

Welcome to the **Face Recognition System** repository! This project demonstrates a face recognition system capable of identifying individuals and analyzing facial data. The system uses computer vision techniques and pre-trained models to achieve high accuracy and performance.

---

## Features

- **Face Detection**: Identifies faces in images and videos using cutting-edge computer vision algorithms.
- **Face Recognition**: Matches detected faces with pre-registered individuals in a database.
- **Real-Time Recognition**: Processes video streams for real-time face recognition.
- **Database Management**: Supports adding, updating, and deleting registered individuals in the database.
- **Customizable Models**: Easily integrate or switch to other face recognition models.
- **GUI Integration**: Includes a user-friendly interface for interaction and testing.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/satviko4/face_rec.git
   cd face_rec
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment**:
   Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare Data**:
   - Add images of individuals to the `database/` folder for training the recognition model.

2. **Run the Application**:
   Launch the face recognition system:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Interact with the GUI** (if applicable):
   - Add new individuals to the database.
   - View recognition results in real-time.
